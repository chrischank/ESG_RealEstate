Here is some basic data on residential transactions in the city of Leeds, England.
The Property Data.csv contains transaction data hastily joined to Energy Performance Certificate data.
To help with location data there is also UK train and metro stations provided in another csv.

There is no strict goal to this exercise. 
What we would like to know is some findings relating to any of the ESG related variables and the price properties transact at in Leeds.
